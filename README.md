# Hangman Game with Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python. The game randomly selects a word from a pre-defined list and the player must guess the letters of the word before running out of guesses.

## Requirements

This game requires Python 3.x to be installed on your computer.

## Installation

No installation is necessary for this game. Simply download the Python script and run it in a Python interpreter.

## Usage

To start the game, run the Python script in a Python interpreter:


The game will start and prompt you to guess a letter. Enter your guess and press enter. If your guess is correct, the game will display the correctly guessed letters in the word. If your guess is incorrect, the game will display the Hangman diagram and update the number of guesses remaining. Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the list of words in the Python script. Simply replace the words in the `words` list with your own words.

## Conclusion

Hangman is a fun and simple game that can be implemented using basic programming concepts. This Python implementation is a great way to practice your Python skills and have fun at the same time!
